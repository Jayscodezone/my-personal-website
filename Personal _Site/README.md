Janaya's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio ! This is a safe space  and is dedicated to Black Women that codes. This repository will be used to highlight my skills, projects, and dev tools that I will master while pursuing a new found career in Full Stack Software Engineering. I am passionate about Coding, DevOps, AI and CSS Animations. I am eager to build interactive web applications and devote my endless learning, focus, and experience in both Front-End and Back-End Development.

This portfolio will contain a collection of my work and accomplishments in order to show case my proficiency in HTML & CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and VS Code. THis is also an encouraging space where I can continue my journey with new learnings and insightful experiments on different libraries and frameworks.
